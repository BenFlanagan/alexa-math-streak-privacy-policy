# Math Streak Privacy Policy

## Terms:

- "We" / "Us" - the developer of Math Streak, Benjamin Flanagan.
- "Amazon" / "Alexa" - Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates).
- "The Skill" / "Math Streak" - the Math Streak skill, developed by Us and available on the Alexa store.
- "You" - the user of The Skill.

## General

This document governs the relationship between You and Us. Your relationship with Amazon is not in the scope of this document, but since You need to interact with Alexa to use The Skill, We make the assumption that You have read and agreed to any relevant policies regarding Your use of Alexa.

## Data

We do not collect any personally identifiable information about You. We do receive data (such as Your unique Alexa user ID) which may be connected to Your personally identifiable information, stored by Amazon. At present We do not use or store such data, nor do We access any such personally identifiable information.

When You use The Skill, We do receive information from Alexa about Your intents and instructions directed at The Skill, so that The Skill can respond to Your requests. We may store anonymous information about these interactions, to be used solely for the purposes of improving The Skill and measuring engagement. We do not provide any information about You or Your use of The Skill to any third party (except Alexa, when necessary to the function of The Skill).

We may in future collect personally identifiable information explicitly provided by You to The Skill, or made available to Us by Alexa with Your permission, for the sole purpose of enhancing Your experience using The Skill.

## Changes

The Skill may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of The Skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of The Skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or The Skill itself will be seen as Your acceptance of both.
